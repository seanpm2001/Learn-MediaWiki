=== About ===

I decided to make WikiText (Wikimedia/MediaWiki) the first project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/learn-MediaWiki) as this project is about learning the WikiText programming language, and showing my knowledge for the language. Its project language file should represent what language is being showcased and studied here.

This is a rare instance in which I am using WikiText/MediaWiki as a project language file, as I learned how to make the GitHub linguist recognize Markdown as a language. I found this out 2 days ago when snooping around on [https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/.gitattributes Apple/Swift Evolution] and I have now expanded it to 4 languages. if you want to do this yourself, simply add this to your <code>.gitattributes</code> file (if you haven't created one yet, make it now, do not add anything else to the file name but <code>.gitattributes</code>)

<code>*.wiki linguist-detectable=true</code>

<code>*.wiki linguist-documentation=false</code>
